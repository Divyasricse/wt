XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.
XML was designed to store and transport data.
XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.
example for xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
 it can be displayed in xml file or display the xml file as a note
 <note>
   <to>Tove</to>
   <from>Jani</from>
   <heading>Reminder</heading>
   <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
note
To: Tove
From: Jani
Heading: Reminder
Body: Don't forget me this weekend!
Why Study XML?
XML plays an important role in many different IT systems.
XML is often used for distributing data over the Internet.
It is important (for all types of software developers!) to have a good understanding of XML.
Important XML Standards
This tutorial will also dig deep into the following important XML standards:

XML AJAX
XML DOM
XML XPath
XML XSLT
XML XQuery
XML DTD
XML Schema
XML Services
introduction to xml:
XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data.

What is XML?
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
XML is a markup language much like HTML
XML was designed to store and transport data
XML was designed to be self-descriptive
XML Does Not DO Anything
Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything.
The XML above is quite self-descriptive:

It has sender information
It has receiver information
It has a heading
It has a message body
But still, the XML above does not DO anything. XML is just information wrapped in tags.

Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive, store, or display it:
The Difference Between XML and HTML
XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are
XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags
The XML language has no predefined tags:

The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard.
These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.
HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.
XML is Extensible:
Most XML applications will work as expected even if new data is added (or removed).
Imagine an application designed to display the original version of note.xml (<to> <from> <heading> <body>).
Then imagine a newer version of note.xml with added <date> and <hour> elements, and a removed <heading>.
With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.
XML Simplifies Things:
XML simplifies data sharing
XML simplifies data transport
XML simplifies platform changes
XML simplifies data availability
Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. Exchanging data between incompatible systems (or upgraded systems) is a time-consuming task for web developers. Large amounts of data must be converted, and incompatible data is often lost.
XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.
XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.
With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc.
